            <p>Setting the width of a block-level element will prevent it from stretching 
                out to the edges of its container to the left and right. Then, you can set 
                the left and right margins to auto to horizontally center that element within 
                its container. The element will take up the width you specify, then the 
                remaining space will be split evenly between the two margins.
                The only problem occurs when the browser window is narrower than the width 
                of your element. The browser resolves this by creating a horizontal scrollbar 
                on the page. Let's improve the situation...</p>

            <p>Using max-width instead of width in this situation will improve the browser's 
                handling of small windows. This is important when making a site usable on mobile. 
                Resize this page to check it out!</p>

            <p>By the way, max-width is supported by all major browsers including IE7+ so you 
                shouldn't be afraid of using it. </p>

            <div class="simple">
                I'm smaller...
            </div> 
            <div class="fancy">
                And I'm bigger!
            </div>


            <div class="static">
                static is the default value. An element with position: static; 
                is not positioned in any special way. A static element is said 
                to be not positioned and an element with its position set to 
                anything else is said to be positioned.
            </div> 

            <div class="relative1">
                relative behaves the same as static unless you add some extra 
                properties.
            </div>
            <div class="relative2">
                Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a 
                relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away 
                from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to 
                fit into any gap left by the element.
            </div> 

            <div class="fixed">
                Hello! Don't pay attention to me yet.
            </div> 

            <div class="relative">
                This element is relatively-positioned. If this element was 
                position: static; its absolutely-positioned child would escape 
                and would be positioned relative to the document body.
                <div class="absolute">
                    This element is absolutely-positioned. It's positioned 
                    relative to its parent.
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
